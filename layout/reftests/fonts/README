Ahem.ttf - ACID3 test font

markXXX.ttf and markXXX.otf

These fonts are autogenerated with FontForge using the Python script mark-generate.py.  
See the comments in that file for more information on how to run the script.

The markX.ttf and markX.otf fonts contain a single glyph for the X character consisting
of three stacked boxes.  The mark2X.ttf and mark2X.otf files also contain just a glyph for the
character X but the glyph is similar to the space mark character.  The markXmark2Y.ttf has
two glyphs, the first glyph for X and the second glyph for Y.

The markA.eot and markB.eot files are for EOT-related testing.  The markA.eot file is just 
a copy of markA.ttf while markB.eot is a valid EOT file embedding the contents of markB.ttf
with a null root string (so it can be used in IE without domain-specific restrictions).
