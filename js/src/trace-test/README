JS Trace Test Suite

* PURPOSE

This is a test suite for testing TraceMonkey. All tests are run in the JS shell
with tracing enabled (-j).

* REQUIREMENTS

Python 3.1: http://www.python.org

* RUNNING THE TESTS

Basic usage:

    python3.1 trace-test.py <path-to-js-shell>

The progress bar shows [#tests passed, #tests failed, #tests run] at the left.
If all tests pass, the output is 'PASSED ALL'. The test suite can be interrupted
at any time with Ctrl+C and partial results will be printed.

To run only the basic tests, not including the slow tests:

    python3.1 trace-test.py <path-to-js-shell> basic

For more options:

    python3.1 trace-test.py -h

* CREATING NEW TESTS

Simply create a JS file under the 'tests/' directory. Most tests should go in
'tests/basic/'. Tests that run a long time (many seconds) should go in
'tests/slow/' so they can be easily excluded from test runs.

All tests are run with 'lib/prolog.js' included first on the command line. The
command line also creates a global variable 'libdir' that is set to the path
of the 'lib' directory. To include a file 'foo.js' from the lib directory in a 
test case:

    load(libdir + 'foo.js')
