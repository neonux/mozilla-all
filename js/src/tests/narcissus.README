To run narcissus with jstests.py, change to the js/src/tests/ directory and run
the following command (which excludes tests that are particularly slow):

  python jstests.py -d -j 4 $OBJDIR/njs -m narcissus.list -x slow-narcissus.txt


The js/src/tests/narcissus directory can be used for any tweaks that might be needed
to make Narcissus work properly.  Currently, Narcissus is failing a number of
tests.  narcissus-failures.txt can be used to ignore those tests.  Note that
narcissus-failures.txt also includes all of the tests from slow-narcissus.txt.

  python jstests.py -d -j 4 $OBJDIR/njs -m narcissus.list -x narcissus-failures.txt
