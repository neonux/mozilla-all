DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

This file is specifically designed to create a page larger than
any screen fennec could run on (to allow panning in both axes).
It is filled with 100x100 pixel boxes that are of unique colour,
so that we can identify exactly what part of the page we are
rendering at any given time. A lot of the tests depend on this
behaviour, so ensure that all the tests pass (on a variety of
screen sizes) when making any changes to this file.
