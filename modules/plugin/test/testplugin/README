= Instructions for using the test plugin =

== MIME type ==

The test plugin registers itself for the MIME type "application/x-test".

== Rendering ==

By default, the plugin fills its rectangle with gray, with a black border, and
renders the user-agent string (obtained from NPN_UserAgent) centered in black.

The test plugin supports the following parameters:

* drawmode="solid"
The plugin will draw a solid color instead of the default rendering described
above. The default solid color is completely transparent black (i.e., nothing).

* color
This specifies the color to use for drawmode="solid". The value should be 8 hex
digits, 2 per channel in AARRGGBB format.

== NPRuntime testing ==

The test plugin object supports the following scriptable method:

* identifierToStringTest(ident)
Converts a string, int32 or double parameter 'ident' to an NPIdentifier and
then to a string, which is returned.

== Private browsing ==

The test plugin object supports the following scriptable methods:

* queryPrivateModeState
Returns the value of NPN_GetValue(NPNVprivateModeBool).

* lastReportedPrivateModeState
Returns the last value set by NPP_SetValue(NPNVprivateModeBool).

== Windowed/windowless mode ==

The test plugin is windowless by default.

The test plugin supports the following parameter:

* wmode="window"
The plugin will be given a native widget on platforms where we support this
(Windows and X).

The test plugin object supports the following scriptable method:

* hasWidget()
Returns true if the plugin has an associated widget. This will return true if
wmode="window" was specified and the platform supports windowed plugins.
