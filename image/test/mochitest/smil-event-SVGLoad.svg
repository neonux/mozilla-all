<!-- Helper file for test_smilEventsAllowedInImages.html
     This testcase uses a valid event "SVGLoad" that isn't whitelisted in
     script-disabled contexts.  So when this file is viewed as an image,
     the SVGLoad-triggered animation shouldn't fire. -->
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1"
     width="100" height="100" id="svg">
  <!-- Red rect for initial bad rendering -->
  <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="red"/>

  <!-- After 100ms, we slide in this lime rect and succeed -->
  <rect x="-600" width="100%" height="100%" fill="lime">
    <animate attributeName="x" by="600" begin="0.1"
             dur="0.1" fill="freeze"/>
  </rect>

  <!-- HOWEVER, if the following "bad" animation successfully registers to
       trigger off of "SVGLoad" (which it shouldn't, inside of an image), then
       this orange rect will slide in first and cover up the lime rect's
       destination area, blocking it from view.

       NOTE: SVGLoad corresponds to "time 0" in the SMIL timeline. So if the
       "bad" animation fires, it'll run before the other one (and will get in
       the way before the lime rect is onscreen, making the test fail). -->
  <rect x="-600" width="100%" height="100%" fill="orange">

  </rect>
