# This file contains a list the of STL headers that have been reviewed
# for exception safety and approved. See
#
#   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=551254
#
# At build time, each header listed here is converted into a "wrapper
# header" that is installed into dist/stl_includes.
#
# If you would like to request a new STL header <foo> be added, please
# file a Core:XPCOM bug with a title like "STL: Review exception
# safety of <foo> for gcc and MSVC".
#

# FIXME: these headers haven't been reviewed yet, but we use them
# unsafely in modules/libpr0n, so we might as well prevent it from
# throwing exceptions
