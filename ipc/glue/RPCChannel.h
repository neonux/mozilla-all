    // 
    // After the worker thread is blocked on an RPC out-call
    // (i.e. awaiting a reply), the IO thread uses this queue to
    // transfer received messages to the worker thread for processing.
    // If both this side and the other side are functioning correctly,
    // the queue is only allowed to have certain configurations.  Let
    // 
    //   |A<| be an async in-message,
    //   |S<| be a sync in-message,
    //   |C<| be an RPC in-call,
    //   |R<| be an RPC reply.
    // 
    // After the worker thread wakes us up to process the queue,
    // the queue can only match this configuration
    // 
    //  A<* (S< | C< | R< (?{mStack.size() == 1} A<* (S< | C<)))
    // 
    // After we send an RPC message, the other side can send as many
    // async messages |A<*| as it wants before sending back any other
    // message type.
    // 
    // The first "other message type" case is |S<|, a sync in-msg.
    // The other side must be blocked, and thus can't send us any more
    // messages until we process the sync in-msg.
    // 
    // The second case is |C<|, an RPC in-call; the other side
    // re-entered us while processing our out-call.  It therefore must
    // be blocked.  (There's a subtlety here: this in-call might have
    // raced with our out-call, but we detect that with the mechanism
    // below, |mRemoteStackDepth|, and races don't matter to the
    // queue.)
    // 
    // Final case, the other side replied to our most recent out-call
    // |R<|.  If that was the *only* out-call on our stack, |{
    // mStack.size() == 1}|, then other side "finished with us," and
    // went back to its own business.  That business might have
    // included sending any number of async message |A<*| until
    // sending a blocking message |(S< | C<)|.  We just flush these to
    // the event loop to process in order, it will do the Right Thing,
    // since only the last message can be a blocking message.
    // HOWEVER, if we had more than one RPC call on our stack, the
    // other side *better* not have sent us another blocking message,
    // because it's blocked on a reply from us.
    // 
    std::queue<Message> mPending;

    //
    // This is what we think the RPC stack depth is on the "other
    // side" of this RPC channel.  We maintain this variable so that
    // we can detect racy RPC calls.  With each RPC out-call sent, we
    // send along what *we* think the stack depth of the remote side
    // is *before* it will receive the RPC call.
    //
    // After sending the out-call, our stack depth is "incremented"
    // by pushing that pending message onto mPending.
    //
    // Then when processing an in-call |c|, it must be true that
    //
    //   mPending.size() == c.remoteDepth
    //
    // i.e., my depth is actually the same as what the other side
    // thought it was when it sent in-call |c|.  If this fails to
    // hold, we have detected racy RPC calls.
    //
    // We then increment mRemoteStackDepth *just before* processing
    // the in-call, since we know the other side is waiting on it, and
    // decrement it *just after* finishing processing that in-call,
    // since our response will pop the top of the other side's
    // |mPending|.
    //
    // One nice aspect of this race detection is that it is symmetric;
    // if one side detects a race, then the other side must also 
    // detect the same race.
