 * MOZ_DELETE, specified immediately prior to the ';' terminating an undefined-
 * method declaration, attempts to delete that method from the corresponding
 * class.  An attempt to use the method will always produce an error *at compile
 * time* (instead of sometimes as late as link time) when this macro can be
 * implemented.  For example, you can use MOZ_DELETE to produce classes with no
 * implicit copy constructor or assignment operator:
 *
 *   struct NonCopyable
 *   {
 *     private:
 *       NonCopyable(const NonCopyable& other) MOZ_DELETE;
 *       void operator=(const NonCopyable& other) MOZ_DELETE;
 *   };
 *
 * If MOZ_DELETE can't be implemented for the current compiler, use of the
 * annotated method will still cause an error, but the error might occur at link
 * time in some cases rather than at compile time.
 *
 * MOZ_DELETE relies on C++11 functionality not universally implemented.  As a
 * backstop, method declarations using MOZ_DELETE should be private.

 * MOZ_OVERRIDE explicitly indicates that a virtual member function in a class
 * overrides a member function of a base class, rather than potentially being a
 * new member function.  MOZ_OVERRIDE should be placed immediately before the
 * ';' terminating the member function's declaration, or before '= 0;' if the
 * member function is pure.  If the member function is defined in the class
 * definition, it should appear before the opening brace of the function body.

 *   {
 *     public:
 *       virtual void f() MOZ_OVERRIDE { }
 *   };
 *
 * In compilers supporting C++11 override controls, MOZ_OVERRIDE *requires* that
 * the function marked with it override a member function of a base class: it
 * is a compile error if it does not.  Otherwise MOZ_OVERRIDE does not affect
 * semantics and merely documents the override relationship to the reader (but
 * of course must still be used correctly to not break C++11 compilers).
