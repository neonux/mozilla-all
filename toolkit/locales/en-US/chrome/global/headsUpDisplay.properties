# LOCALIZATION NOTE FOR `jsPropertyTitle` AND `jsPropertyInspectTitle`:
#
# The "PropertyPanel" is used to display a JS object to the user.
# If it is clear which object is being inspected (e.g., window, document object)
# the title of the panel is based on the `jsPropertyInspectTitle` string.
# If it isn't clear which object is being inspected, the `jsPropertyTitle` string
# gets used. This can be the case when the user logs an object to the WebConsole
# output using the console.log(aObjectToInspect) method.
#
# You can find a screenshot of the PropertyPanel here:
#   https://bug585030.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=464034
jsPropertyTitle=Object Inspector
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (jsPropertyInspectTitle):
#
# The %S is replaced by the evaluated code the user clicked on in the console.
#
# Example: The user executed `window.document` in the WebConsole. The `document`
# object is written to the output. If the user clicks on the `document` output
# in the console, a PropertyPanel will show up. The title of the PropertyPanel
# is set to `Inspect: window.document` because the clicked `document` object was
# evaluated based on the `window.document` string.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (networkUrlWithStatus):

# When the HTTP request is started only the URL of the request is printed to the

# The bracket is not closed to mark that this request is not done by now. As the
# request is finished (the HTTP connection is closed) this string is replaced
# by `networkUrlWithStatusAndDuration` which has a closing the braket.

# %1$S = URL of network request
# %2$S = response status code from the server (e.g. `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`)

# When the HTTP request is finished (the HTTP connection is closed) this string

#
# %1$S = URL of network request
# %2$S = response status code from the server (e.g. `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`)

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (NetworkPanel.imageSizeDeltaDurationMS):
# This string is used to show the duration between the response header and the

# The first %S is replace by the width of the inspected image.
# The second %S is replaced by the height of the inspected image.
# The third %S is replaced by the duration between the response header and the
# response body event.
