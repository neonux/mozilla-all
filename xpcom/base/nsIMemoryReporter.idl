   * The path that this memory usage should be reported under.  Paths can
   * begin with a process name plus a colon, eg "Content:", but this is not
   * necessary for the main process.  After the process name, paths are
   * '/'-delimited, eg. "a/b/c".  There are three categories of paths.
   *
   * - Paths starting with "mapped" represent non-overlapping regions of mapped
   *   memory.  Each one can be viewed as representing a path in a tree from
   *   the root node ("mapped") to a node lower in the tree;  this lower node
   *   may be a non-leaf or a leaf node.  So, for example, "mapped",
   *   "mapped/heap/used", "mapped/heap/unused", "mapped/js/mjit-code",
   *   and "mapped/js/tjit-code" define this tree:
   *
   *     mapped [*]
   *     |--heap
   *     |  |--used [*]
   *     |  \--unused [*]
   *     \--js
   *        |--mjit-code [*]
   *        \--tjit-code [*]
   *
   *   Nodes marked with a [*] have a reporter.
   *
   * - Paths starting with "heap-used" represent non-overlapping regions of
   *   used heap memory.  The "mapped" rules above apply equally here.  These
   *   paths are actually sub-paths of "mapped/heap/used", but that reporter
   *   is duplicated under the name "heap-used" to make the processing for
   *   about:memory simpler.
   *
   * - All other paths represent cross-cuttings memory regions, ie. ones that
   *   may overlap arbitrarily with regions in the "mapped" and "heap-used"
   *   trees.
