The source from this directory was copied from the libfishsound-0.9.1
source distribution using the update.sh script. The only changes made
were those applied by update.sh and the addition/upate of Makefile.in
files for the Mozilla build system.

Some files are renamed during the copy to prevent clashes with object
file names with other Mozilla libraries.

endian.patch is applied to fix Bug 45269.
