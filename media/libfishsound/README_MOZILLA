The source from this directory was copied from the libfishsound git
distribution using the update.sh script. The only changes made
were those applied by update.sh and the addition/upate of Makefile.in
files for the Mozilla build system.

Some files are renamed during the copy to prevent clashes with object
file names with other Mozilla libraries.

The git commit id used was e98a05 from git://git.xiph.org/libfishsound.git

endian.patch is applied to fix Bug 45269.
