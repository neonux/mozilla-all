About Oggz
----------

Oggz comprises liboggz and the command-line tools oggzinfo, oggzdump,
oggzdiff, oggzmerge, oggzrip, oggz-comment, oggz-scan and oggz-validate.

liboggz is a C library providing a simple programming interface for reading
and writing Ogg files and streams. Ogg is an interleaving data container
developed by Monty at Xiph.Org, originally to support the Ogg Vorbis audio
format.

Dependencies
------------

Oggz depends only on libogg, available in most free software
distributions, or in source form at: http://xiph.org/downloads/

Support is built-in for parsing the headers of and seeking to time
positions in Ogg Speex, Vorbis, FLAC, Theora, PCM and CMML. Oggz is also
compatible with Annodex streams, and supports seeking on all tracks
described in an Ogg Skeleton track.

Installation
------------

This library can be installed using the conventional commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make check
    $ sudo make install

sequence. Full details in the file INSTALL.

Read the file README.win32 for installing under MS Windows, and
README.symbian for information about building for Symbian devices.

Source layout
-------------

The src/ directory contains the source code.
The src/liboggz/ directory has the library source code.
The src/tools/ directory has some command line tools for analysing
               Ogg files.
The src/examples/ directory contains example programs using liboggz.
The src/tests/ directory contains unit and functional tests.

The include/ directory contains the oggz include files that will
be installed into the system include directory.

The doc/ directory contains some documentation for oggz. The
subdirectory liboggz is autocreated by doxygen from comments contained
in the source code.

The win32/ directory contains the files necessary to compile the
library and tools for MS Windows.

The symbian/ directory contains the files necessary to compile the
library for Symbian.


Programming with liboggz
------------------------

liboggz supports the flexibility afforded by the Ogg file format while
presenting the following API niceties:

    * Full API documentation

    * Comprehensive test suite of read, write and seeking behavior.
    The entire test suite can be run under valgrind if available.

    * Developed and tested on GNU/Linux, Darwin/MacOSX, Win32 and
    Symbian OS. May work on other Unix-like systems via GNU autoconf.
    For Win32: nmake Makefiles, Visual Studio .NET 2003 solution files
    and Visual C++ 6.0 workspace files are provided in the source
    distribution.

    * Strict adherence to the formatting requirements of Ogg bitstreams,
    to ensure that only valid bitstreams are generated; writes can fail
    if you try to write illegally structured packets.

    * A simple, callback based open/read/close or open/write/close
    interface to raw Ogg files.

    * Writing automatically interleaves with packet queuing, and provides
    callback based notification when this queue is empty

    * A customisable seeking abstraction for seeking on multitrack Ogg
    data. Seeking works easily and reliably on multitrack and multi-codec
    streams, and can transparently parse Theora, Speex, Vorbis, FLAC,
    PCM, CMML and Ogg Skeleton headers  without requiring linking to those
    libraries. This allows efficient use on servers and other devices
    that need to parse and seek within Ogg files, but do not need to do
    a full media decode.

Full documentation of the liboggz API, customization and installation,
and mux and demux examples can be read online at:

Tools
-----

The Oggz source tarball also contains the following command-line tools,
which are useful for debugging and testing Ogg bitstreams:

    * oggzinfo: Display information about one or more Ogg files and
    their bitstreams.

    * oggzdump: Hexdump packets of an Ogg file, or revert an Ogg file
    from such a hexdump.

    * oggzdiff: Hexdump the packets of two Ogg files and output
    differences.

    * oggzmerge: Merge Ogg files together, interleaving pages in order
    of presentation time.

    * oggzrip: Extract one or more logical bitstreams from an Ogg file.

    * oggz-comment: List or edit comments in an Ogg file.

    * oggz-scan: Scan an Ogg file and output characteristic landmarks.

    * oggz-validate: Validate the Ogg framing of one or more files.
