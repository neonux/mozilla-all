The source from this directory was copied from the liboggz-0.9.7
source distribution using the update.sh script. The only changes made
were those applied by update.sh, which applies a patch from
seek.patch, and the addition/upate of Makefile.in files for the
Mozilla build system.

The seek.patch address a bug in liboggz when a seek call returns an
error. It also addresses an issue where the guess for the seek
position can exceed the file size. These will be upstreamed to liboggz.
