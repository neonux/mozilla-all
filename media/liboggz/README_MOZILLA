The source from this directory was copied from the liboggz-0.9.7
source distribution using the update.sh script. The only changes made
were those applied by update.sh, which applies a patch from
seek.patch, and the addition/upate of Makefile.in files for the
Mozilla build system.

The seek.patch address a bug in liboggz when a seek call returns an
error. It also addresses an issue where the guess for the seek
position can exceed the file size. These will be upstreamed to liboggz.

The warning.patch addresses a printf in liboggz that is not wrapped
in a DEBUG #ifdef. See Mozilla bug 450891 and Annodex ticket 431:

The wince.patch addresses the lack of posix file IO suppor on windows ce see bug 461844 for details.
