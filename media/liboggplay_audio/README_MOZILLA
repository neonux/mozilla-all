The liboggplay_audio code is from the audio portion of the Annodex
browser_plugin svn repository:

http://svn.annodex.net/browser_plugin/trunk/src/audio/

It was originally part of liboggplay but recently split into the
separate browser_plugin directory. I only use the audio portion so
only the audio part of the source is here. Run update.sh giving it the
path to a checked out version of browser_plugin to update this code.

This code is using svn revision r3605 and apply the patch from bug 449564.
