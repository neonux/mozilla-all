Snapshots of cairo and glitz for mozilla usage.

We only include the relevant parts of each release (generally, src/*.[ch]),
as we have Makefile.in's that integrate into the Mozilla build system.  For
documentation and similar, please see the official tarballs at
http://www.cairographics.org/.

VERSIONS:

  cairo (12d521df8acc483b2daa844d4f05dc2fe2765ba6)
  pixman (7862f9b96e8e8456cc60852790c7f244a5e3425e)

***** NOTE FOR VISUAL C++ 6.0 *****

VC6 is not supported.  Please upgrade to VC8.

==== Patches ====

Some specific things:

max-font-size.patch: Clamp freetype font size to 1000 to avoid overflow issues

win32-logical-font-scale.patch: set CAIRO_WIN32_LOGICAL_FONT_SCALE to 1

nonfatal-assertions.patch: Make assertions non-fatal

buggy-repeat.patch: Unconditionally turn on buggy-repeat handling to bandaid bug 413583.

cairo-version-fixes.patch: fix up cairo-version.c/cairo-version.h for in-place builds

win32-ddb-dib.patch: fix for bug 455513; not upstream yet pending feebdack

wince-fixes.patch: stubs out win32 functions we use but are not supported on win32.  Also implements ExtSelectClipRgn in terms of other functions available on wince.

win32-vertically-offset-glyph.patch: bug 454098; vertical positioning errors when drawing glyph runs including delta-y offsets on screen via GDI

ignore-rank0.patch: bug 474886; Not redrawing the background when changing page on flickr

win32-canvas-glyph-position.patch: bug 475092; horizontal positioning errors when drawing glyph runs with delta-y offsets to canvas through win32-font

win32-cleartype-clipping.patch: bug 445087; some glyphs are clipped, mainly on right-hand edge, when ClearType is enabled and drawing to RGBA canvas

on-edge.patch: reverts the in-fill semantic change.

wrap-source_image.patch: make sure we don't free the source image until we're done with it.

zero-sized.patch: deal with zero sized surface in ways less likely to crash.

text-path-filling-threshold.patch: use path filling instead of platform glyph rasterization at a smaller size threshold of 256 device pixels, if the backend supports native filling (which we assume will be fast).

zombie-face.patch: bug 486974; leak and possible crash with @font-face{src:url()}.  Upstream commit: 0238fe2cafea2e1ed19bb222117bd73ee6898d4d

win32-raster.patch: bug 498689; use scanline rasterizer on win32

quartz-falback.patch: try to fix Quartz fallback-to-pixman path; possiby incorrect and obsoleted by Andrea Canciani patch

quartz-repeating-radial-gradients.patch: use Quartz to render repeating radial gradients instead of falling back

quartz-const-globals.patch: make some Quartz color function data const globals instead of local variables

quartz-minimze-gradient-repeat.patch: reduce the number of gradient stop repetitions we use, to improve quality of Quartz's gradient rendering

quartz-first-stop.patch: return the first stop for negative positions on the gradient line of a nonrepeating linear gradient

quartz-glyph-extents.patch: bug 534260; work around incorrect glyph extents returned by quartz for anomalous empty glyphs

premultiply-alpha-solid-gradients.patch: bug 539165; multiply the solid color by the alpha component before using it for a solid surface

xlib-initialize-members.path: bug 548793; initialize XRender version if the server doesn't have the extension

remove-comma: remove a comma from enum

d2d.patch: add d2d support

fix-zero-len-graident.patch: fix zero length gradients

fix-clip-copy.patch: fix clip copying

fix-clip-region-simplification.patch: fixes a bug in clip region simplifications

expand-in-stroke-limits.patch: expand the in-stroke limits to avoid a bug

d2d-dwrite.patch: update the d2d/dwrite stuff

add-a-stash-of-cairo_t-s.patch: use the stash to avoid malloc/freeing cairo_t's

bgr.patch: fix image wrapping

disable-server-graidents.patch: disable server-side gradients

clip-invariant.patch: make rasterization closer to being clip invariant

fix-unnecessary-fallback.patch: avoid unnecessary fallback

handle-a1-upload.patch: handle a1 image uploads through converter

surface-clipper.patch: remove an incorrect optimization

fix-win32-show-glyphs-clipping.patch: fix a clipping bug

native-clipping.patch: Add support for a native clipping api

quartz-is-clear.patch: Propagate the quartz is_clear flag.

==== pixman patches ====

pixman-rename-and-endian.patch: include cairo-platform.h for renaming of external symbols and endian macros

==== disable printing patch ====

disable-printing.patch:  allows us to use NS_PRINTING to disable printing.
